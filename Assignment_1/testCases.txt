Test case #1:
first number = 10
second number = 5
operation = 1

Observation: Result: 10 + 5 = 15

When asked to perform another calculation and recieving a yes answer it starts from the beginning (goes to the next iteration of the while loop)

This was my next input:
first number = 8
second number = 2
operation = 3

Observation: Result: 8 * 2 = 16

When asked to perform another calculation and recieving no it outputs "goodbye!" and program terminates
