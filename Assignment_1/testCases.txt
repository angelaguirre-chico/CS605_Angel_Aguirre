TEST CASE #1:
first number = 10
second number = 5
operation = 1

Observation: Result: 10 + 5 = 15

When asked to perform another calculation and recieving a yes answer it starts from the beginning (goes to the next iteration of the while loop)

This was my next input:
first number = 8
second number = 2
operation = 3

Observation: Result: 8 * 2 = 16

When asked to perform another calculation and recieving no it outputs "goodbye!" and program terminates

TEST CASE #2:
first number = one

At this point the program states "This calculator only supports integers" and ask the user to enter the first number again

first number = 1
second number = 2
operation = Division

The program will state "Please Enter an Integer" and prompt the user to enter an operation number

operation = 4

The program will output:

1 / 2 = 0.5

The program wil prompt the user if they want to continue or not. The user says now and the programs writes goodbye and terminates.

TEST CASE #3:
first number = 100
second number = 0
operation = 4

The program state that you cant divide by 0 and prompt again for you to enter the operation number

operation = 3

The program outputs:

100 * 0 = 0

The program then prompts the user to perform another calculation. The user chooses no and the program says goodbye and terminates.

TEST CASE #4
first integer = 1357908642
second integer = 2468024680
operation = 3

The program will output:

1357908642 * 2468024680 = 3351352041641284560

The program then prompts the user to perform another calculation. The user chooses no and the program says goodbye and terminates.
