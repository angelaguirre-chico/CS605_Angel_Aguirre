## How to use:

The program will ask you to enter the first number.
After that the program will ask you to enter the second number.

Next the program will ask you to select an operation.
You can select the following:

- Division (Enter 4)

**Note:** No other operations are supported. If you attempt to enter anything else the program will tell that the operation is not supported and will ask you to select an operation.
**Note:** You cannot divide by 0. If you try this the program will let you know and ask you to select an operation.

Once operation is selected you will be able to see the result. The program will prompt you if you want to perform another calculation. If you type yes the program will start from the beginning. If you type no the program will say goodbye and terminate
