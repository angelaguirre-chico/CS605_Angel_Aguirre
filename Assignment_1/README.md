# Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

## How to use:

The program will ask you to enter the first number.
After that the program will ask you to enter the second number.

**Note:** both numbers must be integers. You will be asked to enter both numbers again if you enter another type.

Next the program will ask you to select an operation.
You can select the following:

- Addition (Enter 1)
- Subtraction (Enter 2)
- Multiplication (Enter 3)
- Division (Enter 4)

**Note:** No other operations are supported. If you attempt to enter anything else the program will finish and it will ask if you want to do another calculation

Once operation is selected you will be able to see the result. The program will prompt you if you want to perform another calculation. If you type yes the program will start from the beginning. If you type no the program will say goodbye and terminate
